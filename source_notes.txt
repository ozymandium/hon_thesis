Scott's Thesis
    --what is the difference between DGPS and DRTK?
    - RPV's RMS error ~ 0.0033 m when fixed integer ambiguity estimates available
        - significantly higher when floating point ambiguity estimates only used
    - slight increase in variance as separation distance increases
        - >600m single freq will not produce a high precision solution
    -- Chap 4 is on following

LF/DRTK SBIR

Distributed Leader-Follower Navigation of Mobile robots
    - not very useful, mostly controls

Vision-based Localization of Leader-Follower Formations
    - leader carries out all computation
    - one leader many followers
    - a lot of controls

Precise gps sensor subsystem for vehicle platoon control
    -- referenced by scott's thesis
    -- use carrier phase to maintain spacing
    -- results for static and moving base station
    -- in absence of truth data, used measured vector between two fixed antennae to validate results
    -- mostly just shows that DRTK/RTK is good for use in convoys, long range stuff
    - accuracy is same up to 7200 m

Nonlinear Control for Urban Vehicles Platooning, Relying upon a Unique Kinematic GPS
    -- mostly control law design
    -- use RTK and reference
