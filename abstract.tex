% what the guis do
Two graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are presented which are intended to aid convoy drivers.
Both tools are designed to be used in following the path of a lead vehicle with high precision.
% difference between them
A `monolithic' GUI is presented which emphasizes clean and concise display of information.
A GUI using Google Earth as a backend is presented which allows the user to view the path of a lead vehicle overlayed onto satellite imagery.
The internal structure of each tool is examined in detail.
% testing
Experimental testing is performed in three scenarios.
Free following is tested in an environment similar to American highways, and one with very few visual landmark by which to localize; another path replication test is performed wherein the following vehicle cannot make visual contact with the lead vehicle at all.
The results of experimental testing are used to compare performance of the two visual aids as well as to determine whether they increase path fidelity in following vehicles.
